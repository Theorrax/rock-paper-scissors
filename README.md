# Rock, Paper, Scissor JavaScript Project 
This project is an exercise to demonstrate a working knowledge of JavaScript functions, and basic Boolean operators. 

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissor game playable in the console. In a later exercise following the completion of the Rock, Paper, Scissor project a Graphical User Interface will be created. 

Objectives: 
- Create a blank HTML document with a script added. 
- The game will be played against a computer, make a function called <strong>getComputerChoice</strong> that will randomly return either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". 
- Write a function that plays a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The function will take two parameters - the <strong>playerSelection</strong> & <strong>computerSelection</strong>. 
- Return a string that declares a winner of the round like so "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
- Make the function's playerSelection parameter case in-sensitive. 
- You want to return the results of this function case, not "console.log()" them.
- Write a new function called "game()". Use the previous function inside of this one to play a five round game that keeps score & reports a winner or loser at the end. 
- Loops are permitted to be used in this project although not covered in the curriculum yet. 
- Use "console.log()" to display the results of each round and the winner at the end. 
- Use "prompt()" to get input from the user. 

## Note 
This project is not meant to have a GUI, this project must be accessed through the console in devtools. 

## Reflection 
After completing this project I feel a sense of satisfaction due to the daunting nature of this project. This is the first true programming task that i've ever had to complete before. Therefore, there was a steep learning curve to overcome. All together this project took about two weeks to complete. There was plenty of head banging days trying to understand how to write an array, how to write functions, and continuos debugging through the project. This project will be revisited with two goals in mind in the coming weeks. The first task will be to write a loop to replace the lines from 45-54. Secondly, A graphical user interface (GUI) will be added at some point in the future as well. Over all, this was a great, and Google questions that I had to overcome my challenges throughout the project.
