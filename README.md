# Rock, Paper, Scissor JavaScript Project 
This project is an exercise to demonstrate a working knowledge of JavaScript functions, and basic Boolean operators. 

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissor game playable in the console. In a later exercise following the completion of the Rock, Paper, Scissor project a Graphical User Interface will be created. 

Objectives: 
- Create a blank HTML document with a script added. 
- The game will be played against a computer, make a function called <strong>getComputerChoice</strong> that will randomly return either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". 
- Write a function that plays a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The function will take two parameters - the <strong>playerSelection</strong> & <strong>computerSelection</strong>. 
- Return a string that declares a winner of the round like so "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
- Make the function's playerSelection parameter case in-sensitive. 
- You want to return the results of this function case, not "console.log()" them.
- Write a new function called "game()". Use the previous function inside of this one to play a five round game that keeps score & reports a winner or loser at the end. 
- Loops are permitted to be used in this project although not covered in the curriculum yet. 
- Use "console.log()" to display the results of each round and the winner at the end. 
- Use "prompt()" to get input from the user. 

## Note 
This project is not meant to have a GUI, this project must be accessed through the console in devtools.
